# lazy_cat_lang

Lazy cat is a programming language that aims to be so simple that any programmer can learn its features in around a half hour

# how to use

Currently there are two main ways to use lady cat, you may run a script that uses the extension .lc by using the command

```
lazy_cat hello_world.lc
```

## Basics

* variables

Lazy cat is a weak typed language so if you want to create a variable it is only required that you say its name and then its value like this:

```
a = 10
b = "abc"
```
* print

the show the variables content just print it!

```
print a
print b
```

* loops

For now there are only two types of loop, the iterative one and the not iterativo.

the iterative loop is used when you need to know the index of the loop, you can assign the index to a variable like I for example as shown below

```
for i in 1 to 5:
  print i
end
```

this loop will go from 1 to 5, the number of the iteration is represented by I, it's also important to pay attention on the 'end' token, it specifies where is the end of this loop


## current features

* arithmetic calculations with integers
* assignment of values in variables (only strings and integers for now)
* string concatenation
* print function
* for loop
* for in I loop
* if block
